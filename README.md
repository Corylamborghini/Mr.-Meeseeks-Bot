  <p> Hello People! This is a personal bot I use for my own server but if anyon ehas suggestions or ideas for it I am all ears. I am just beginning learning how to code so I apologize for this being fairly useless to many. I am trying to create a bot for my Dischord server and just wanted it to send out updates and such. Thank you for your time and I am sorry if this is a let down because I don't really know how or where to start. </p>
